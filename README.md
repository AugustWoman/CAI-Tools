# News
Character AI developers are constantly updating the website. This comes with many new issues for this extension and I would like to have your new Github issues or emails for reporting. Feature requests are also welcome.

# Known problems
- Chat duplication doesn't work on Firefox because of Firefox's extremely strict WebSocket policies or whatever. It doesn't even give me error message

# Feature List
###### Background Manager (premium)
Activate or disable Main and Roleplay background however you wish. Roleplay backgrounds work with the message input, if you start with "##" and start typing for a keyword, it will search in your custom and starter roleplay background list keywords. Upon clicking on a keyword, it will change the background. You could create a huge library of your own. Image links are strongly recommended if you don't want delays or lags, try Imgur or other image upload sites. (Doesn't support legacy website.)
###### Font Manager (premium)
Change your text sizes and font families for a better experience, especially if you have bad eyes.
###### Character Import (premium)
You can import character cards and .json files and it will create a private character with the those settings. Character.ai, V1 and V2 cards should work, not tested with others if there are any. https://chub.ai recommended for having many SFW options.
###### Memory Manager
Reminds the character whatever you want every X message. You can choose the frequency. You can activate or deactivate it in the menu. Remind the character about history, settings, plot, scenario, anything.
