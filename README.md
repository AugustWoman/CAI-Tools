###### Download as Tavern chat

###### Download to read offline
It downloads an .html file which is a web page. You can read all your conversations offline with this file.
###### Raw Dump (json)
It downloads the entire chat history and includes your character settings. You can use these two options to train models.
###### Raw Dump (anonymous)
This is a better option if you want to hide your first name, username, display name etc.
###### Download as example chat
This turns your chats into example chat/definition format so you can re-use them, both in CAI and Pygmalion AI. It downloads a .txt file, which is a text document. All you need to do is copy paste the content.

If you are in View Chat Histories page, it will download the entire history in this format. If you are in a conversation page, it will download only that chat.
###### Passive
Shows up to 999 chats in "View Chat Histories". You can download it all. The limit they put was originally 50.

###### JSON_to_ReadOffline.html
You can download this file individually. This can convert your existing .json character/history dumps into readable format, similar to "Download to read offline". Open this file, upload your dump in the input at middle-top of the page, that's all.
